# Baby Jaxson's Webpage

This is a website my brother and I are making for family to see and interact with pictures of my first child.

- We want users to be able to sign up or log in so that they can comment on pictures.
- We also have a guest option where users can continue without loging in. In this case they can still see pictures, but cannot comment on them.
- Stats section for baby details like height and weight.
- Friends section for pictures of his favorite people he meets.
- Review section is a place for us parents to leave highlights of our new journey with a newborn as he grows.
